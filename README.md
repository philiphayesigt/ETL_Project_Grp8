# ETL_Project_Grp8

## Does a good book make a good movie?

Our goal for the ETL Project will be to create two tables, one for books and one for movies. 

From Kaggle.com we found a dataset for books listed on Goodreads.com (https://www.kaggle.com/jealousleopard/goodreadsbooks) and a dataset for movies listed on IMDB.com (https://www.kaggle.com/orgesleka/imdbmovies).

Once we have the datasets extracted, we will drop any unnecessary information and clean what data we remains. We will then load these two tables into a SQL database on Postgres.

With two clean tables loaded into our database, we plan to define movies and books that share a title and pull the ratings for both mediums into one table. This allows analysis to be completed on the quality of books in relation to their film adaptation.
