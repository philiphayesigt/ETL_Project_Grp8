# ETL_Project_Grp8

## Does a good book make a good movie?

Our goal for the ETL Project will be to create two tables, one for books and one for movies. 

From Kaggle.com we found a dataset for books listed on Goodreads.com (https://www.kaggle.com/jealousleopard/goodreadsbooks) and a dataset for movies listed on IMDB.com (https://www.kaggle.com/orgesleka/imdbmovies).

Once we had the datasets extracted, we worked to drop any unnecessary information and clean what data we had. 

With two clean tables loaded into our database, we defined movies and books that shared a title and pulled the ratings for both mediums into one table. This allows analysis to be completed on the quality of books in relation to their film adaptation.
